## note - needed for scheduler script to function ##
## note - "dst-limit" can be changed to suite your needs as required ##
/ip firewall filter add action=jump chain=DDoS
/ip firewall filter add action=return chain=DDoS dst-limit=128,64,src-and-dst-addresses/1s
/ip firewall filter add action=add-src-to-address-list chain=DDoS address-list=DDoS


## note - To be placed in scheduler and run every 5~10min ##
## note - the ">=20" and the "<5" can be changed to suite your specific needs ##
:if ([/ip firewall address-list print count-only where list="DDoS" dynamic=yes]>=20) do={/interface disable sfp1}
:if ([/ip firewall address-list print count-only where list="DDoS" dynamic=yes]<5) do={/interface enable sfp1}


## note - can be solved with netwatch for clients to stay on, but note you will need more than one fiber entry piont for this to work ##
## note - with this solution your IP that gets attacked can get disabled on the physical layer and the clients can run through the backup fiber or internet source ##
/ip route add dst-route=8.8.8.8 gateway=##upstream ip or gateway##
/tool netwatch add host=8.8.8.8 up-script="/ip firewall mangle disable [find comment="Client Backups"]" down-script="/ip firewall mangle enable [find comment="Client Backups"]"
